- 👋 Hi, I’m @NandaniRamoliya
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and exploring new technologies that push the boundaries of what's possible.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning blockchain and cloud computing, diving deep into these transformative fields.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on public projects related to Machine Learning (ML) or Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data Structures
  and Algorithms (DSA) using Python, PHP backend development, and Java applications.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can email me at nandaniramoliya@gmail.com for any interesting discussions or collaboration opportunities.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the first computer programmer was a woman named Ada Lovelace? She wrote an algorithm for Charles Babbage's
  early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. As a programmer, I find it inspiring that women have been involved in computing from the very beginning!
